# AStupidRobot-USELESS-
A small program about a robot....yeah,  that's it


## Boring Text

This program is made by a total noobie, don't expect some really cool code style or something else here.
It's really just a program with no use other than learning.

Code made with the glamorous IDE Pycharm

## Python

This program is, idk why I dare to say this, designed for python 3.6. It might not work
on others versions of python.

Not like somebody will really test it other than me :P
